### [실제 예문 #2]
```
[man 3.]
Growing up, I wanted to be like Hugh Hefner, a stylish guy who can have his pick of the litter.
But there comes a time in every man's life where he has to settle down.
I'm so ready to find a wife.
[laughter and indistinct conversation.]
[woman.]
Oh, my gosh, you guys! - [woman 3.]
Hi! - Hey, hey! - [women cheering.]
- Oh, my God! - Hi! - Hi! How you guys doing? - [woman 4.]
Freaking out a little bit! - [man 4.]
Yeah? Welcome.
I'm Vanessa Lachey.
I'm obviously Nick Lachey, her husband.
Ladies, welcome to the blind love experiment.
[cheering and laughing.]
Here, you will choose someone to marry without ever seeing them.
[women chuckling nervously.]
We live in such a disconnected and distracted world.
Your value is often judged solely by the photo on your dating app.
- Mm-hmm.
[chuckles.]
- [women.]
True.
That's true.
```
