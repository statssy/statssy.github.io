What are Challenges and Key Principles for ML Systems

---

## Challenges and Key Principles for ML Systems

### Specific Challenges of ML Systems

- The need for reproducibility (versioning everywhere)
- Entanglement
- Data Dependencies(데이터 의존성은 이미 수행된 데이터의 변화가 뒤의 수행 결과에 영향을 끼치는 것을 의미)
- Configuration issues
- Data and feature preparation
- Model errors can be hard to detect with traditional tests
- Separation of expertise


### ML System COntributors
The architecure of a production machine learning system needs to take into account business requirements, as well as the unique challenges at the intersection of data science, software engineering and devops.


### Research vs. Production Environments
- Research : Seperate from customer facing software, Can be taken offline
- Production : Reproduciblity matter, Infrastructure planning required


### Key Principles for ML Sysytem ARchitecture
- Reproducibility : Have the ability to replicate a given ML prediction
- Automation : Retrain, update and deploy models as part of an automated pipeline
- Extensibility : Have the ability to easily add and update model
- Modularity : Preprocessing/feature engineering code used in training should be organized into clear pipeline
- Scalability : Ability to serve moel predictions to large numbers of customer(within time constraints)
- Testing : Test variation between model versions


### Unknown Word

- Entanglement : a situation or relationship that you are involved in and that is difficult to escape from  
(The book describes the complex emotional and sexual entanglements between the members of the group.)
