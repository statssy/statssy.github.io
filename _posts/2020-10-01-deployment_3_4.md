Architecture Component Breakdown

---

## Achitecture Component Breakdown - Train by batch, predict on the fly


### High Level Archetecture
- Data Layer : access to all of our data sources which simplifies the challenge of data reproducibility
- Feature Layer : responsible for generating feature data in a transparent, reusable and scalable manner
- Scoring Layer : tranforms features into predictions. Scikit-learn is the industry standard for this layer
- Evaluation Layer : check the equivalence of two models(live vs. training). This layer can be used to monitor production models

- CI/CD Pipeline(Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery)
: 애플리케이션 개발 단계를 자동화하여 애플리케이션을 보다 짧은 주기로 고객에게 제공하는 방법
