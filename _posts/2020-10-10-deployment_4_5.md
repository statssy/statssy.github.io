# 4.5 Should feature selection be part of the Machine Learning automated pipeline?


## Feature selection in CI/CD 장단점

Advantages
- Reudced overhead in the implementation of the new model
- THe new model is almost imediately available to the business systems


Disadvantages
- Lack of data versatility
- No additional data can be fed through the pipeline, as the entire processes are based on the first dataset on which it was built


## Feature selection in CI/CD

Suitable:
- Model build and refresh on same data
- Model build and refresh on smaller datasets


Not Suitable:
- If model is built using datasets with a high feature space
- If model is constantly enriched with new data sources
