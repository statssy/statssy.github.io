### [실제 예문 #1]- 20.02.19 정리
```
["Go Get What You Want" playing.]
You're walking through your memories You're looking for an answer Don't wanna waste your days away 
[man 1.]
When I heard about this experiment, I knew it was for me.
It was the opposite of what modern dating has become.
[woman 1.]
There's so many dating apps, and most of them are based off of your physical appearance.
[man 2.]
It's not all about physical attraction, in the long run.
It's who's holding your hand on your deathbed.
[woman 2.]
The reason I came here is there's men who actually want to get married, they want commitment.
They're looking for wives.
I'm like, "What? Where?" 
["Go Get What You Want" continues.]
Wash your fears away Away Your heart is singing out You're breaking through the clouds Go get what you want Go get what you want 
[gasps.]
- Wow.
- Hi! [woman laughing.]
[Briana.]
I'm Briana! I really want a man who is going to love me for me.
Not what I look like, but for who I am on the inside.
When we're 95 years old, my boobs might be, like, dragging on the floor, but I need you to love my saggy boobs.
That was real extra, but that's really how I feel.
Oh, shit.
This is dope.
Oh, man! I'm short, and there are women out there that won't date guys that are shorter.
Westley.
It's a bummer, but being in this facility, we're really getting down to what matters most.
