### Headline
Investors see value stocks like banks leading the way in the second half, CNBC survey finds

### Key Point
- CNBC polled about 100 Wall Street investors about where they stood on the markets for the rest of 2021.
- Nearly 70% of the respondents said value stocks will do better than their growth counterparts in the next quarter.
- On the sector level, the majority of investors (67%) believe financials will be a winning trade for the rest of 2021.

Wall Street investors believe inexpensive and economically sensitive stocks will retake the lead in the market in the second half of 2021, according to a new CNBC survey. 

As a part of CNBC’s Quarterly Report, we polled about 100 chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers and CNBC contributors who manage money about where they stood on the markets for the rest of 2021. The survey was conducted from June 23 to June 30.

Nearly 70% of the respondents said value stocks will do better than their growth counterparts in the next quarter.

After an impressive rebound from pandemic lows, the rally in value shares took a pause as the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policy pivot and inflationary pressures made investors reassess the outlook for economic growth. The Russell 1000 Value Index fell 1.3% in June, trailing its growth counterpart by more than 7 percentage points as tech stocks outperform with bond yields stabilizing.

Investor could be betting on a rotation back into value on the belief that the case for economic recovery remains intact and should result in rising yields again in the coming months. Nearly half of the survey respondents said the 10-year Treasury yield will top 2% by the end of the year. The benchmark rate last traded around 1.46% after hitting a high of 1.75% in March.

On the sector level, the majority of investors (67%) believe financials will be a winning trade for the rest of 2021. The S&P 500 financials sector is the second best performer this year, up 24.5% year to date
