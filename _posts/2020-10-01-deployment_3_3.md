## Design Approaches to ML System Architecture

### General ML Archtecure Comparison
: Focus of this course Pattern 1(REST API) - best trade-off for most cases

|                              | Pattern 1 (REST API) | Pattern 2 (Shared DB) | Pattern 3 (Streaming)       | Pattern 4 (Mobile App)       |
|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Training                     | Batch                | Batch                 | Streaming                   | Streaming                    |
| Prediction                   | On the fly           | Batch                 | Streaming                   | On the fly                   |
| Prediction result delivery   | Via REST API         | Through the shared DB | Streaming via Message Queue | Via in-process API on mobile |
| Latency for prediction       | So so                | High                  | Very Low                    | Low                          |
| System Management Difficulty | So so                | Easy                  | Very Hard                   | So so                        |
